    "\n",
    "Logging in Python is pretty simple and well-standardized, thanks to a powerful logging framework right in the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules should simply log everything to a logger instance for their module name. This makes it easy for the application to carry log messages of different modules and eventually send them to different places, if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Applications have several options to configure logging. Unless specifically needed, simply logging and letting system or your container handle log messages is sufficient and the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "That concludes the basic tutorial. It should be enough to get you up and running with logging. There’s a lot more that the logging package offers, but to get the best out of it, you’ll need to invest a little more of your time in struggling with the Python documentation. If you’re ready for that, grab some of your favourite beverage and carry on.\n",
